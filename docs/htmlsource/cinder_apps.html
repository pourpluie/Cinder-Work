<h2>Understanding Cinder Apps</h2>
<p>In general, Cinder users want to create apps. They may create a standard desktop application, an iOS or Windows Store app, a screensaver, or a number of other types of project. Cinder provides a framework for each of these, and more specifically it provides a C++ base class derived from <d>ci::App</d>.</p>
<br />
<p>Cinder apps follow a basic structure which we'll look at now. Below is a minimal Cinder application which animates a circle from right to left.</p>

<pre style="background-color:#EEEEEE"><code>
#include "cinder/app/AppBasic.h"
#include "cinder/app/RendererGl.h"
#include "cinder/Vector.h"

using namespace ci;
using namespace ci::app;

class CirclePusherApp : public AppBasic {
  public:
	void	setup();
	void	update();
	void	draw();
	
	Vec2f	mCirclePosition;
};

void CirclePusherApp::setup()
{
	mCirclePosition = Vec2f( 0, getWindowHeight() / 2 );
}

void CirclePusherApp::update()
{
	mCirclePosition += Vec2f( 0.1f, 0 );
}

void CirclePusherApp::draw()
{
	gl::clear();
	gl::color( Color( 1.0f, 0.5f, 0.25f ) );
	gl::drawSolidCircle( mCirclePosition, 25.0f );
}

CINDER_APP_BASIC( CirclePusherApp, RendererGl )
</code></pre>

<p>In this code we see an example of a minimal Cinder application called <code>ExampleApp</code>. Cinder apps fundamentally are classes derived from one of several specific base classes. In this case <d>app::AppBasic</d>, which is Cinder's base class for standard desktop Mac OS X and Windows apps.</p>
<br />
<p>For common operations, users override several virtual methods in order to implement their app's behavior. The first of such methods is <code>setup()</code>, which gets called just after the application's default <d>Window</d> has been created. In our example above, we initialize our circle's position variable to be at the left-middle of the window.</p>
<br />
<p>After <code>setup()</code> has been called, Cinder enters its event loop, where it fires <code>update()</code> followed by <code>draw()</code> until your application quits. In this loop it also fires any event handlers, which we'll explore later. In our example application, the <code>update()</code> method moves the circle position <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> of a pixel per frame.</p>
<br />
<p>Finally, the <code>draw()</code> method. Here we're using Cinder's OpenGL methods to first clear the window (which defaults to black). Next, we set the current color to be a shade of orange. Last, we draw a filled circle using <d>gl::drawSolidCircle()</d>, passing the position variable as the location and <code>25</code> as the radius.</p>
<br />
<p>The last bit of code to notice is the <code>CINDER_APP_BASIC</code> call. This is a macro which cause some additional setup code to be created in order for your app to run. You can think of it as a Cinder's <code>main()</code> routine, and in fact one of the the things the macro creates is your platform's equivalent of the classical C/C++ <code>main()</code>. The second parameter selects which kind of renderer your application will make use of. In additional to OpenGL Cinder provides Cairo, DirectX and other types of renderers.</p>
